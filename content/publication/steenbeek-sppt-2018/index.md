abstract: "sppt is an R package that implements several Spatial Point Pattern Tests. The first version of the package started with Martin Andresenâ€™s original Spatial Point Pattern Test, but several other functions have been implemented since.  The tests in this package measure the degree of similarity at the local level between two spatial point patterns and is an area-based test. They are not used for the purpose of testing point patterns with the null hypotheses of random, uniform, or clustered distributions, but may be used to compare a particular point pattern with these distributions. One advantage of the tests is that they can be performed for a number of different area boundaries using the same original point datasets."
